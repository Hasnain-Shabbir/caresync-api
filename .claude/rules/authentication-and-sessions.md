# Authentication and sessions (security critical)

- **Never** call `JWT.decode` with verification off (`JWT.decode(token, key, false)`) anywhere. Never trust a token's payload before the signature and expiry are verified. Verification belongs to the library (devise-jwt and Warden), not to hand-written decoding.
- Tokens are revocable: an allowlist row per token, deleted on logout. Password change, password reset, archive, and access revoke delete the user's allowlisted tokens.
- Absolute expiry is 30 minutes. There is no idle timeout yet (a known gap).
- Login failure, unknown email, and locked account return **one** message and code (`INVALID_CREDENTIALS`). Reset requests always report success. Never reveal whether an email has an account, in the message, the status, or (as far as possible) the timing.
- Lock after 5 failed attempts for 1 hour (Devise lockable). A reset unlocks the account (documented decision).
- Reset tokens are single use and expire in 6 hours. Passwords never appear in logs or job arguments.
- Rate limiting and throttling on the anonymous operations is in `config/initializers/rack_attack.rb`. Do not weaken it.
- Secrets (`devise_jwt_secret_key`) live in credentials. Never print or copy them (see `no-env-access.md`).

## Required negative tests (keep them passing)
Garbage token, expired token, token after logout, token after password change, wrong password, unknown email, locked account, reused or expired reset token.

## Process
Any change in these files needs a security read-through before it is called done: forged input, replay, enumeration, and what is logged.
